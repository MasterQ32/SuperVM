## jmpi
Pops an index from the stack and jumps to it.

## ret

## load8
Loads a byte (8 bit) from $arg.

## load16
Loads a half world (16 bit) from $arg.

## load32
Loads a word (32 bit) from $arg.

## load8i
Pops an address from the stack and loads the byte (8 bit) located at the popped address.

## load16i
Pops an address from the stack and loads the half world (16 bit) located at the popped address.

## load32i
Pops an address from the stack and loads the word (32 bit) located at the popped address.

## store8
Pops a value and stores it as a byte (8 bit) at $arg.

## store16
